------- Description -------
A Django and React web store. Where users can register and post products for sale, and review other users. I plan on integrating Stripe for payment processing.

------- Technology -------
HTML, CSS, Django, React, Bootstrap, Postgres

------- User Stories -------
As a visitor I’d like to browse listed items. I’d also like to register for an account once I find one I’d like to buy.

As a user I’d like to post an item for sale. Never mind I’d like to edit that posting.

As a user I’d like to buy a listed item. I’d like to pay with my card and have shipping calculated based off my address.

As a merchant I’d like the users to be able to review if I’ve given them good quality service.

As a merchant I’d like users to be able to pay me as seamlessly as possible.
